## 📻 TECHNOLOGIES
We have **TWO Categories** of engineering taking place under the `Spoonified` moniker, so please see the two following sections for more detail.  

### 🧰 HARDWARE
- Proof of Concept (PoC) Hardware constructed to assess feasibility
-- `UTD ECE` Team Join --   
> @ben, feel free to add here as you see fit, or send me what you would like added. -- @jason  

### 💻 SOFTWARE
- Proof of Concept (PoC) Built <sub><i>(see HARDWARE header above)</i></sub> to connect and rudimentarily connect to the prototype. 
-- `UTD CS` Team Join --  
- (In Progress) Back & Forth with ECE & Testing Image Resolutions / Deresolution 
  - CLI Tool to test Deres'ing, along with other image manip  
  - Discussion of schema which will define the Hardware <-> Software integration with `ECE`  
  - Assessment of PassioSDK for image recognition
